<p>Maybe, when all this is done, the defining image of the time will be the unknown surfer sprinting up the beach in La Jolla, on the run from a lifeguard boat. Heâ€™d just paddled out and broken the San Diego surfing ban, his act of civil disobedience cheered on by the crowd in the street. Local surfer Derek Dunfee, who captured the whole thing on video, described it as â€œone of the best things Iâ€™ve ever seen at the beach.â€ Surfing as defiance. The waves werenâ€™t even that good, but nothing was going to stop that kid from paddling out. When interviewed laterâ€”his identity hidden behind a maskâ€”the fugitive teenager offered, â€œSurfing should be brought back to the world because we really need it.â€</p>

<p>Back in April, they were simpler days. We only had to deal with a pandemic and a few corona copsâ€”not the breakdown of social order, the upending of world geopolitics and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Since the scattered beach bans lifted, however, weâ€™ve at least had surfing. With many liberated from employment and free to surf, surfers around the world have been able to paddle out at their local break and wash it off. As the world went mad, the people went surfing. It was a splendid, simple spell, with the experience rendered back to its elemental partsâ€”surf, surfer, surfboard. The worse things got, the more essential surfing became.</p>

<p>Less essential, it turns out, was a world surfing tour. This was the first year in 45 that the Tour didnâ€™t run. Not a heat surfed in anger. The Corona Open on the Gold Coast was the first event cancelled by the coronavirus. As it turns out, this virus wasnâ€™t just deadly to human beingsâ€”it was deadly to professional surfing. The Tour has been on a ventilator all year. You could not have engineered a more fatal condition for the sport: not only were borders closed, not only was the global economy tanking, but there was something deeper happening with surfers themselves. It was a shift in attitude. They were too busy surfing to even notice the Tour was gone.</p>

<p>The Bells Beach Easter contest didnâ€™t run this yearâ€”a first since 1962. If Bells had run, it would have scored. Easter Monday and Tuesday were bluebird days. Light offshore, double overhead on a 16-second period. Sunny, warm and not a pro surfer in sight. No bleachers, no broadcast, no Kelly Slater and no â€œHells Bellsâ€ blaring from loudspeakers to start the day. Instead there was a very different energy. Bells was still full of punters, but they were all in the water surfing themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was happening at Bells was happening everywhere. The world stopped turning but the waves kept coming and people reconnected with their surfing in a way that a warp-speed world never seems to allow. Week after week, it got into a beautiful rhythm, and concern for the looming End of Days stopped at the tide line. In the water, no one talked much about competitive surfing. That seemed to belong to another time entirely.</p>

<p>Ian Cairns hitched a ride to the 1970 World Contest at Bells Beach. In the car headed south from Sydney was a cosmopolitan crewâ€”Californians Corky Carroll and Dru Harrison, Hawaiian Dana Nicely and Kiwi White from South Australia. It rained the whole way and the windscreen wipers didnâ€™t work. Cairns, a very serious 18 year old, spent much of the trip with his head out the window in an effort to avoid second-hand smoke. It was still raining when they arrived at Bells late in the afternoon and with nowhere to stay, Cairns grabbed his swag and curled up in the corner of the beach bathrooms. He pulled out his copy of â€œMan-Eaters of Kumaonâ€ and drifted off to sleep reading about Colonel Jim Corbett hunting tigers in colonial India. Young Ian was all blood and thunder and he was very ready for the World Contest.</p>

<p>It didnâ€™t quite pan out as he imagined. SURFERâ€™s coverage of the 1970 World Contest was headlined, â€œThe Death of All Contestsâ€, and it wasnâ€™t hyperbole. With the exception of young Cairns, it appeared very few people actually wanted to be there. Nat Young had just moved to Byron Bay and showed up looking like heâ€™d been harvesting mushrooms down the back paddock. Ted Spencer bailed the day before the contest started and soon found Krishna. David Nuuhiwa went home to California early in protest against the Victorian weather. Wayne Lynch was about to disappear from pro surfing entirely to conscientiously object the Vietnam War. Everyone was on their own trip, including the guy who stayed long enough to win the thing. Rolf Aurness collected his trophy at the Lorne Hotel the night after the event ended and never surfed another contest again. Cairns watched on bemused, part of a new breed whose time hadnâ€™t yet come.</p>

<p>The competitive paradigm had totally receded. The World Contest 2 years later in San Diego flopped in shitty gray surf and it was only the Peruvians and their supplement program that lifted communal spirits. The â€™74 World Contest was cancelled due to lack of interest. Small enclaves fought pitched surfing battles at places like Pipe and Bells, but the idea of these tribal rituals coalescing into anything remotely resembling a â€œsportâ€ seemed fanciful. Cairns, at his competitive peak during this period, referred to it disdainfully as â€œsham amateurismâ€.</p>

<p>Surfing elsewhere became kaleidoscopic. The zeitgeist was freedom and self-expression and it manifested in the first great wave of surf travel, shape-shifting shortboards and country soul escapism. None of this was happening in isolation, of course. The changes in surfing were set against a backdrop of wider social upheaval. Surfers were being carried along with it, but in many ways were also out in front. Timothy Learyâ€™s throw-aheads and all that. Contests sat as a thoroughly-uncool counterpoint to all this.</p>

<p>Ian Cairns knows pro surfing well. He invented it. In 1976, Cairns, alongside Peter Townend, devised a ratings system and crowned a world champ at the end of the seasonâ€”which just happened to be Townend. Cairns was second. In the decades since, heâ€™s filled pretty much every role in the sport. At certain points heâ€™s been the sport. He founded the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP), won at Waimea, wore a Bronzed Aussies jumpsuit and watched on as the â€™86 OP Pro riot set his pro surfing dreams on fire. Heâ€™s unapologetically pissed people off over the years, mostly those whoâ€™ve got between him and his vision for pro surfing. Cairns is a true believer. â€œI believe in the opportunity for young kids to make a life for themselves in competitive surfing.â€ Ian grew up in a surfing outpost in Western Australia and worked on a potato farmâ€”pro surfing was his way out, and up.</p>

<p>But like any true believer in pro surfing, it also drives him insane. In 4 decades, the World Tour has rarely settled into a comfortable groove. Nobody can ever agree on how to run it. Itâ€™s been on the bones of its ass several times and has never found a wider audience beyond a masochistic surfing core. And yet itâ€™s still here. Talking to Cairns just after the WSL announced the cancellation of the 2020 Tour, and a recalibrated 2021 Tour, he wasnâ€™t impressed. â€œAll theyâ€™ve done is put lipstick on the pig. Itâ€™s the same tour the IPS had 40 years ago with a new logo. You have the same events, the same format, the same broadcast and the same business model. The WSL have just put a bit of buff and polish on it, but itâ€™s the same thing.â€</p>

<p>The World Surf League brass are the first true outsiders to take charge of the sport. When they acquired the Tour back in 2013, they ran a traditional major league business model: run the events and sell the broadcast rights, advertising partnerships and event licenses. Kicking the tires when they bought it from the ASP, they wouldâ€™ve known surfing had only a marginal audience, consisting mainly of core surfers. They werenâ€™t the first to believe in the existence of a great, mythical, non-surfing audience. But as non-surfers themselves, the WSL figured they were better placed to go find it. Seven years later and itâ€™s been a slow, painful reveal.</p>
