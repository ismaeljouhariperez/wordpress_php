<p>For those of you who might have missed the news this weekend, Alex Honnold completed a free-solo climb of El Capitan at Yosemite. A free-solo climb is as extreme as you can get when it comes to mountain-climbing.<br>-No ropes.<br>-No nothing.<br>-3,000 feet straight up.<br>-You slip and fall...<br>-You die.<br><br>In my opinion, this is the greatest athletic achievement ever. Don‚Äôt agree with me?<br>Clearly, this risk involved here is just absurd. But the last minute of the video also makes it crystal clear he is experiencing absolute joy in his talent. How many people who are offered the gift of life can really say this?<br><br>This is my favorite quote from Alex:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‚ÄúYears ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free solo Freerider, there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like, ‚ÄòOh that‚Äôs a scary move and that‚Äôs a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse,‚Äô‚Äù Honnold said. ‚ÄúThere were so many little sections where I thought ‚ÄòUghh ‚Äî cringe.‚Äô But in the years since, I‚Äôve pushed my comfort zone and made it bigger and bigger until these objectives that seemed totally crazy eventually fell within the realm of the possible.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<p>You can read more about Alex‚Äôs perspective in his own words in this National Geographic interview, taken while he was still infused with the adrenaline of having just accomplished one heck of a monster goal. It‚Äôs fun to hear someone when they are at the absolute top of their game.</p>

<h2>What does this have to do with tech startups and Prime Movers?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Floodgate, we talk about how it‚Äôs our job to celebrate the Prime Movers, before the rest of the world believes. But Prime Movers exist everywhere. Whether you want to create‚Ä¶<br>-A theory (like Einstein)<br>-Or a philosophy (like Aristotle, Plato, and Voltaire)<br>-Or a song (like Elvis)<br>-Or a small step (like Neil Armstrong)<br>-Or a dream (like Martin Luther King).<br><br>What ultimately what matters is this: Life is short. We are all tiny specks of humanity in a potentially infinite universe that has lived for billions of years and will endure for billions more. You don‚Äôt know how much time you will have in your life. The only thing we know is that no one has ever (yet) escaped their mortality.<br><br>Steve Jobs was right when he said that ‚Äúknowing that you will die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.‚Äù<br><br>Congrats to you Alex Honnold. A ‚Äúsurface-level‚Äù way to recognize you would be to say that you are the ‚Äúbest.‚Äù But it‚Äôs about more than this. You have found your gift and you have shown the courage to pursue it and honor it, on your own terms, without apologies. And you have used your talent to further causes for the environment that matter and that have gone overlooked for too much time. You are a Prime Mover and then some‚Ä¶in the truest sense of the word‚Ä¶<br><br>Every time I hear that you might be about to embark on an even crazier climb on an even bigger mountain, with even more risks involved‚Ä¶I pray for your success. But I also realize that no matter what happens‚Ä¶you are living your life, your way, under your terms, according to your passion, leveraging your gift. So you have already lived a great life no matter what happens in the future. (Having said this, I still pray you never fall!)<br>Congratulations on completing a climb that is way more than just a climb.</p>
