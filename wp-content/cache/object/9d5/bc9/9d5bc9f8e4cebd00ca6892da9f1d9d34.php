<p>There are few occasions that canâ€™t be made better with a bottle of wine. But during the fall and winter months we find ourselves searching for something a little cozier. Enter warm mulled wine, or glÃ¼hwein as itâ€™s called in Germany. This spiced red wine cocktail is the perfect way to keep warm during this winter and smooth out any unexpected wrinkles that the holidays might throw your way.<br><br>It doesnâ€™t take much to make: a bottle (or two) of red wine, some oranges, cloves, cinnamon sticks, ginger, and few drizzles of maple syrup. Simmer in a big pot over low heat until all the flavors start to blend together. When itâ€™s ready, it tastes like warm, liquid comfort in a mug.<br><br>This is the perfect cocktail to try while doing some late-season camping or at the cabin during a winter ski trip. When the weather is brisk, this drink will be your best friend.<br><br>Fresh Off the Grid is Michael van Vliet and Megan McDuffie. Read more at Fresh of the Grid at freshoffthegrid.com.</p>
